# Data
The data collected for his project was Billboard's Top 100 songs from the week of September 9, 2025. We utilized different websites and compared to see if there was a relationship between the number of artists and if they song is hip-pop. We looked at apple music to see if it was hip-pop, if it was it = 1, and if it was not it =0. We looked at each song individually to see the number of songwriters. i then counted how many song writers were in each song.
